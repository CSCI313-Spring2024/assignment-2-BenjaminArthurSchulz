<h2><center> Yeah that's me. I'm the small kid with glasses in the middle, the one with the himalayan expedition shirt. Pretty sure this was taken at a 6th grade spelling bee competition, I don't think I did too good but I got to miss a day of school so worth</h2>

<h3>My name is Benjamin A Schulz, I was born  on August 1st, 2001 6 weeks early, and on my Grandpa's birthday no less so that's cool, I grew up<br>
in a small town called Jamestown in North Dakota and I lived there most of my life, only moving to Fargo recently to attend classes at NDSU.<br>
Here are a few fun facts about my life, When I was in the 1st grade on November 11th (don't ask me how I remember the exact day) my gloved<br>
hands slipped of the icy monkey bars and I landed on my arm breaking the two bones that make up my forearm, and the administrators and the<br>
Catholic school I attended put me in the Teacher's lounge while they called my mom to ask her to take me to the hospital. Instead of laying<br>
me on the nice soft couch that was in there they took some chairs that were around a table, stuck em together, and had me lay on that. I was<br>
in gymnastics for a few years after a friend had their birthday party at the special gym we have for it in town, but I quit because I was one<br>
of very few boys, and it always felt like the people working there were parading me around, I kinda wish I stuck with it though would've been <br>
really cool to get good at a lot of those tricks. The only other sports I really participated in were Soccer and Cross-Country, my dad was a<br>
Soccer coach so that was a given but I also really enjoyed Cross-Country, my only problem was how horrible the courses at competitions were.<br>
<br>

I am a Computer Science major mainly because when in High School the only class I enjoyed that was a feesible career path was a Programming<br>
class I took junior year, and with the industry growing as it is it looked like a pretty safe option. I don't have many aspirations outside of wanting<br>
to get a stable job that makes enough to support a comfortable life style, I've never been too good planning things out but after I graduate I<br>
can always go back to working at Domino's for a bit to save up some money and figure my life. Although if I do want to get into the industry<br>
ASAP my uncle offered me an internship at the place he works so I do have some options depending on how I feel in a few years.
