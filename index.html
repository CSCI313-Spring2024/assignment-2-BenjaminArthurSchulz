Welcome to the Wacky Crazy Insane Spectacular Fantastical Stupendous Magical Interdimensional Repetitive Insane but a 2nd time WILD a little Dumb and toally 100% Original Website made by, yours truly, Benjamin A Schulz. If that English Professor's worst nightmare of an intro sentence didn't tell you everything about me then that means it's doing its job. There'd be no point for the other pages to be here otherwise, speaking of theres nothing of value here so click one of the links above to go somewhere else.
